    <h1>Distributed Locks</h1>
    <p>
      There are 10K concurrent users on an online store, and they all try to buy
      the last sneaker in stock at the exact same time. How do you make sure
      that only one person gets it?
    </p>
    <h2>Intro to Locks</h2>
    <p>
      If you know what mutexes are, feel free to skip this section. Say you have
      10K threads running the following function:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code> 
    int counter = 0;
    void *func(void *arg){
        counter += 1;   
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The expected value of counter is 10K, but this is not guaranteed.
      <code>counter += 1</code>
      does three things: reads the value of counter, adds 1 to it, and sets
      counter to it. If two threads read the same value of counter before
      incrementing it, it will effectively only increase by 1. We can use locks
      to guarantee that every thread increments counter exactly once:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
    int counter = 0;
    pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
    void *func(void *arg){
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        counter += 1;   
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    }
        </code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      The code between the <code>pthread_mutex_lock/unlock()</code> is called
      the critical section, which only one thread that "acquires the lock" is
      allowed to execute at a time.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Distribtued Lock?</h2>
    <p>
      A distributed lock is like a mutex, but it synchronizes access to
      resources in a network rather than within a machine. When there are
      several clients requesting to access a resource, locking can enforce that
      only one of them gets it.

    <h3>Naive Approach</h3>
    <p>
      We can use Redis to achieve a naive (but decent) implementation. To make
      it clear, I will use the example of booking rides on an app (Uber). A
      driver can only ride with one person at a time, so we must "lock" a driver
      when the client books a ride with them.
    </p>
    <p>To lock a driver, we could use the following command:</p>
    <code>SET &lt;driver_id&gt; &lt;client_id&gt; NX</code>
    <p>
      In plain english, this command tells Redis to set the (driver_id,
      client_id) key-value pair only if the key does not already exist (hence
      the NX flag). If this command fails to set the key, it indicates that the
      driver is locked by some other client.
    </p>
    <img src="images/locks2.png" alt="" style="width: 100%" />
    <p>
      The client can delete the <code>&lt;driver_id&gt;</code> key from Redis
      once their ride is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also if you are wondering, all single commands in Redis are <i>atomic</i>.
      For us, this means that it will execute the SET instructions one at a
      time.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem?</h3>
    <p>
      This implementation is quite error-prone even disregarding security
      issues, etc. A big problem with this approach is that the whole app stops
      working when this redis instance fails. This is called a
      <strong>single point of failure</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Redlock Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      This algorithm uses an odd number of <strong>independent</strong> Redis
      instances (no replication) to avoid a single point of failure. Here is my
      simplified summary of the algorithm:
    </p>
    <p>
      To lock a driver, a client can <strong>sequentially</strong> send a
      <code>SET client_id driver_id NX</code> command to each Redis node and
      keep a tally of how many of these execute successfully.
    </p>
    <img src="images/locks3.png" alt="" width="100%" />
    <p>
      If a majority of the nodes successfully execute the command, then the
      client has aquired the lock for that resource. After the client has
      finished, it has to release the resource by deleting the driver_id in
      <strong>all</strong> redis nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent live/deadlocks and buggy clients from hogging locks, we can add
      a few more steps to the algorithm.
    </p>
    <img src="images/locks4.png" alt="" width="100%" />
    <ul>
      <li>Record the current time, T (= 0 in the above picture)</li>
      <li>Use an auto-release time for the key (eg. 10 seconds)</li>
      <li>Timeout when waiting on a specific node's response (eg. 50ms)</li>
      <li>
        After everything, make sure that the current time (Now) - T &lt;
        auto-release time (so that no key has expired)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The client now has some time to use the resource before the lock expires
      called the validity time. This can be calculated by subtracting elapsed
      time from the initial validity time (10s from the first request is sent to
      the Redis node).
    </p>
    <p>
      This solves the single point of failure problem. If we have 5 nodes, up to
      2 of them can fail and our app will still work.
    </p>
